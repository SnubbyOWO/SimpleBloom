# Simple Bloom
This Bloom is used on unity webgl. It is a light weight bloom so it doesn't look amazing but it gets the job done. I made this while working on Slime Rancher because I wanted it to have bloom like the original game but I also didnt want the game to lag like crazy. So I came up with this. Surely theres better but as long as it gets the job done it works. Though it probably needs some fixing.
